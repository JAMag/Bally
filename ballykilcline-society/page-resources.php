                <p>Mary Lee Dunn</p>
                <p>It's 1847. In the third year of Ireland's Great Famine and the thirteenth year of a massive rent strike against the English Crown, hundreds of tenant farmers in Ballykilcline were removed from their homes by the Queen's agents and then shipped to a different city in a different country -- America. Mary Lee Dunn tells the Ballykilcline farmer's story in this meticulously researched book. Using numerous sources from both Ireland and the United States, both public and private, she traces dozens of the farmers to Rutland, Vermont. There railroads and marble quarries were briskly transforming the local economy. She traces the immigrant farmers until 1870 and learns their story -- not only what happened to them but also what the American experience brought to their Irish "rebellion."</p>

                <p>Peter Duffy</p>
                <p>At the height of the Irish Famine, now considered the greatest social disaster to strike nineteenth-century Europe, Anglo-Irish landlord Major Denis Mahon was assassinated as he drove his carriage through his property in County Roscommon. Mahon had already removed 3,000 of his 12,000 starving tenants by offering some passage to America aboard disease-ridden "coffin ships," giving others a pound or two to leave peaceably, and sending the sheriff to evict the rest. His murder sparked a sensation and drove many of the world's most powerful leaders, from the queen of England to the pope, to debate its meaning. Now, for the first time, award-winning journalist Peter Duffy tells the story of this assassination and its connection to the cataclysm that would forever change Ireland and America.</p>

                <p>The Strokestown Park Archive is one of the largest estate collections in existence in Ireland, with more than 50,000 documents comprising rentals, leases, accounts, correspondence maps, drawings, architectural plans, and photographs. Of particular importance are the papers that relate to the Great Irish Famine. This book introduces the reader to the archive and provides an microscopic insight into the many and varied experiences of Famine for those who inhabited the estate in the 1840s.</p>
